## The Developer Dilemma

We have a problem as developers. Actually, we have many problems. We have problems that we need to solve, as well as problems that have been solved for us. The _actual_ problem being: learning how others have solved the problems we encounter, so that we can become better developers.

Now, I hear you. StackOverflow exists. You can find a solution to your immediate problem via a quick post or search. The problem here is that the solution you receive is removed from a working example. Or, worse yet, it is someone's guess as to how they would solve a problem.

How can you easily verify that someone's proposed solution actually works?

## exloc

The goal of an exloc is to provide a _working_ solution that you can download and run, immediately. <exloc.io> is a collection of code examples. Each exloc has helped someone else solve a specific problem. An exloc could possibly help you to solve your specific problem, with some modification.

### Each exloc includes...

* A codebase.
* Metadata (exloc.json)
  - The **resources** used when researching the problem, and discovering the solution.
  - The necessary **setup commands** for the codebase.
  - The **test commands** to run the test suite.
* Documentation (exloc.md)
  - A description of how the codebase works.
  - Any other relevant information the author deems fit.

The aim here is to document the problem solving process, so that others may learn the craft of software development.

## Software Development as a Communal Activity

Software development (software engineering, programming, coding) is a communal activity. Many other people have collaborated to create the Operating System you are working on, the programming language you use, all the way down to the hardware you use to execute your code. All of this was built by people who had to work together, make choices, weigh the pros and cons of decisions, and ultimately decide how to implement their idea, with some given constraints. <exloc.io> is an attempt to bottle this some part of this collaborative decision making process, so that others may learn.
